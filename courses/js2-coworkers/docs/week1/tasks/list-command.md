### Problem

We need to provide a way for members to access the member data we have stored.

For our initial MVP let's create a CLI (command line interface) tool that lets users pull this data up in a terminal (old school!).

### User Story

As a member, I would like to view a list of all members in the organisation

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can run a command from the command line and see a list of all members
2. The output is displayed in a humnan-readable format that can be quickly digested
3. Only key information is displayed
