Hi {{user}}!

## About me

I am the virtual product onwer for this project. My job is to understand users' needs so that we can build a product that really helps people.

How do I do this? By talking to users and stakeholders to find out what problems they need solved, and to learn about how people are currently solving their problems.

From these discussions I create _user stories_, which describe how particular users will be able to solve their problems once the work is done.

What I don't do is describe how a something should be built â€“ I leave that to the designers and developers. My job is all about people!

## Working together

To keep track of our progress, I've created a project board where I will add tasks and users stories. (You can find it by going to the projects tab).

We'll talk about the project board more once the rest of the team have joined the project.

## Next steps

To mark the current step as done just close this issue. You can then return to the CYF Learning Lab to complete your next onboarding step.
