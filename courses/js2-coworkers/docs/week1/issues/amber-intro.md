Hi {{user}}!

## About me

As scrum master, I help the team to achieve their project goals and resolve any blockers. I do this by promiting the processes and princple of the [scrum framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum).

Each day I check-in with the whole team to discuss the status of the tasks we're working on. I keep track of the progress we're making using the project board.

Although I'm the one keeping an eye on the board's progress, each team member is still responsible for keeping it up-to-date.

## Working together

Every week we'll take some of the user stories Malachi has created and commit to completing them.

## Next steps

1. Close this issue to complete this onboarding step

2. Find the highest priority task in the project board (we place the most important tasks at the top), and assign it your self.

3. Once you have assigned the card to yourself, drag it to the _In Progress_ column.

4. Read the description carefully and use Uma's advice in the comment to complete the task.
