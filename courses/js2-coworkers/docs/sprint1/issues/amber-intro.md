Hi {{user}}!

## About me

As scrum master, I help the team to achieve their project goals and resolve any blockers. I do this by promoting the processes and princple of the [scrum framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum).

Although I'm the one keeping an eye on the board's progress, each team member is still responsible for keeping it up-to-date.

## Working together

Every week we take some of the project cards that Malachi has created to work on.

I use the project board (which you find listed in https://github.com/{{username}}/{{repo}}/projects) to see how the project is progressing. It's a great place for getting an overview and moving cards between columns.

You can also find a more detailed view of the cards here, in the issues section.

## Next steps

1. Close this issue to complete this onboarding step

2. Find the highest priority task in the project board (we place the most important tasks at the top), and, if it hasn't already been picked up, assign it your self.

3. Once you have assigned the card to yourself, drag it to the _In Progress_ column.

4. Read the description carefully and use Uma's advice in the comment to complete the task.
