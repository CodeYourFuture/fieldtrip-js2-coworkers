Hi {{user}}!

## About me

I am the virtual technical lead for this project. In robot years, I've been a developer for nearly a decade now. Every year I make fresh mistakes, but with each mistake I learn what pitfalls to avoid â€“ and am here to help you avoid them!

## Working together

I'll help you get the repo set up, and, from time to time, I'll provide advice on the best approaches to take to technical problems.

## Next steps

1. Close this issue to complete this onboarding step

2. Find the pull request I have opened. It has some boilerplate code and setup instructions. Review the code and once you're happy merge the PR.
