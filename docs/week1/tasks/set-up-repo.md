Uma, once you're invited to the project, can you take this on?

We just need the repo set up with the structure you want {{username}} to follow so we can get started on the tasks.

Acceptance criteria:

- {{username}} can start on the first tasks
- There are clear instructions on how to contribute to the repo
- There are clear instructions on how to run the code
