Hi!

My job is to understand users' needs so that we can build a product that really helps people. I do this by talking to users and stakeholders to find out what problems need to be solved and learn about how users are currently solving these problems.

From these discussions I create user stories, which describe how particular users will be able to solve their problems once the work is done.

What I don't do is describe how a story should be built â€“ I leave that to the designers and developers. My job is all about people!

## Next Steps

I've create a board for our project where we can track changes.

To complete this step, head over to the projects board and assign the highest priority task to yourself.
